# car_vs_truck_classification
Predict whether the given image is of a car or of a truck.

This project deals with an image classification problem where we need to classify whether the given image is of a Car or a Truck.

A dataset of 10,000 images is taken each of the size 128X128.

These images are then trained upon a self defined image classification model made from Tensorflow and Keras.
